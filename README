I ran "time ./bt.A.x" with 1,8,16,32,64,128,156 threads all labled as 12_<numthreads>.txt using these simple commands
to compile/run the file I used 

time ./bt.A.x

without chnging anything it should run with whatever defaoult num of threads on your pc is
to change the num of threads used:
run
nano ~/.bashrc

then copy and paste this at the bottom of that file:

#edit this to run nas benchmarck with diffrent number of threads
#dont forget to run #source ~/.bashrc# to change the enviorment
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<num of threads you want>

then to update the enviorment run:

source ~/.bashrc

if you did it right you should see on the output the num of threads has changed
